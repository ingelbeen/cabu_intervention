# "Optimising Community Antibiotic Use and Infection Control With Behavioural Interventions in Burkina Faso and DR Congo (CABU-EICO project)"
This repository contains the study protocol, questionnaires, and analysis scripts. Anonymised data collected for this study will be added when data collection and curation completed.

## Project summary
We developed and evaluated a behavioural intervention bundle, targeting any community-level healthcare or medicine providers and communities, to optimise antibiotic use and improve hygiene, and hence reduce AMR prevalence and transmission. After a 6-month local co-development phase, the intervention was implemented over 12 months in 22 clusters (villages or neighbourhoods) within health demographic surveillance sites in Nanoro, Burkina Faso and Kimpese, DR Congo. In a cluster RCT, we compared the 22 intervention with 22 control clusters. The primary outcome measure is the change in Watch antibiotic provision from medicine stores (where a formal prescription is not required), assessed via patient exit interviews and simulated client visits. Changes in hygiene practices and AMR pathogen and gene carriage were assessed in repeated household surveys. Rodents stool is used as a proxy estimate of environmental AMR pathogen and gene exposure. Using modelling and sequencing of selected human and rodent isolates, we will quantify how changes in antibiotic use and hygiene practices impact AMR transmission.

## Data 
Anonymized datasets will be available after database closure. 

## Data analysis scripts
Script are in R. Analyses can be run on the open anonymized dataframes available on this repository.
1. "/link_labresults.R" is code to link human and rodent stool data entries to bacteriology results during 3 rounds in the DRC
2. "/patientsurvey.R" is code to clean and link patient survey data pre and post intervention in Burkina Faso and DR Congo
3. "/householdsurvey.R" is code to clean and link household survey data pre and post intervention in Burkina Faso and DR Congo
